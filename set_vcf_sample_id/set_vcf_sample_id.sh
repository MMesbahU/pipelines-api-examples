# set_vcf_sample_id.sh
#
# Simple shell script which can be used to change the "sample ID" in
# a single-sample VCF file. For example, suppose your VCF "header line"
# looks like:
#
#   #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT SAMPLE-001
#
# but you want it to look like:
#
#   #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT SAMPLE-001-TEST-01
#
# and you have note just a single VCF, but many (maybe one VCF per chromosome).
#
# This script can be run on a list of VCFs to update the header.
# The VCFs can be uncompressed or compressed with gzip or bzip2.
# If the input VCFs are compressed, then the output VCFs will be too.
#
# ** Note that this script will delete the input VCF from the local disk. **
# ** This script is intended to be run as part of a Pipeline on a VM in   **
# ** the cloud. Deleting the local copy of the input file allows for the  **
# ** disk to be sized at less than 2x all of the input VCF files, namely: **
# **                                                                      **
# **    disk size ~= 2*size(largest uncompressed VCF)                     **
# **                 + size(remaining VCFs)                               **
# **                                                                      **
